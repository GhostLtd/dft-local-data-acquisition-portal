## Introduction

The Department for Transport (DfT) is developing a digital data collection tool to gather financial and statistical data returns from external stakeholders. This information will support
the Department’s statutory functions, policy development, and production of official statistics.

The tool will collect information provided in data returns. This may include:

* financial information (e.g. expenditure, revenues, funding allocations);
* operational or statistical data (e.g. service usage, volumes, activity data);
* organisation contact details for the purposes of administering the return.
 
The Department does not intend to collect personal data beyond what is necessary for contacting named organisational representatives.

## What data we are collecting and how we will use it

We are processing the following personal data:

* Names
* E-mail addresses
* Contact numbers
* Organisations

Personal data is required to contact relevant authorities and ensure there is an adequate audit trail of who is providing data to the Department for Transport on behalf of external
organisations.

## Our lawful basis for collecting your data

Under data protection law, the lawful basis for processing your data is:

[Article 6(1)(e)](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/lawful-basis/a-guide-to-lawful-basis/public-task/) – public interest

Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

Where contact details of individuals are processed, this is necessary for the administration of data returns.

## Data sharing

Data collected will be used within DfT for analysis and reporting. Where relevant, anonymised and aggregated results may be published as official statistics in line with the UK Statistics Authority Code of Practice. We will not share identifiable data with third parties unless required by law.

## How long we retain the data

We will retain the data in line with DfT’s records management policy.
