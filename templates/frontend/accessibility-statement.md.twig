This accessibility statement applies to [{{ url('app_dashboard') }}]({{ url('app_dashboard') }}).

This website is run by Department for Transport. We want as many people as possible to be able
to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of
JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## How accessible this website is

This website largely conforms to AA accessibility standards but we know some aspects of this
website are not fully accessible:

- You are not able to turn off or adjust the time in which inactivity will result in a loss of data,
which is 1 hour. To deal with this we have implemented a text warning that will appear
when 5 minutes remain of the hour of inactivity, giving you time to click to extend your
session
- In order to display the financial data in a practical way, we have developed a new
template that falls outside of the Government Design System. This has not yet been
tested for accessibility at the time of this statement&#39;s publication.

## Enforcement procedure

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public
Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the
‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact [the
Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com).

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

The Department for Transport. is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with
the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations
2018.

## Compliance status

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)
standard, due to the exceptions listed below.

## Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

- You are not able to turn off or adjust the time in which inactivity will result in a loss of data,
(which is 1 hour).

    A user session expires an hour after they last performed any interaction with the site that resulted
in a page load - that is any form submission, or link or button click.

    A short session time is a requirement for security reasons and a recommendation of security
testing.

    To allow you to continue to use the website if you need more time on a particular page, we have
implemented a warning banner which appears when a session of inactivity has five minutes
remaining and provides a link allowing you to extend your session.

- The financial data tables use a format that has not yet been tested for accessibility at
the time of this statement’s publication

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We will commission an accessibility test and report in May 2025 in order to test the section
of the service that uses new functionality that deviates from the Government Design System
templates. We will act on recommendations from the report to improve accessibility.

We are working alongside other government departments and agencies to fix content which
fails to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 AA standard.
